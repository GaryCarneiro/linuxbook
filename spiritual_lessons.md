System Debugging and Spiritual Lessons

- System is impartial to everyone. Just like Nature.

While debugging any issue, the efforts are rewarded to anybody who tries to find the cause of the problem in all the surrounding chaos. Just because you spend more time with the problem does not mean you made progress. The progress is measured when you move in right direction. Quality and Quantity are two different metrics in Debugging issues.

- System adapts to corrections. Human beings are bit slow to this.

Whenever we find an issues we apply a fix. Think of this code patch as a correction in behaviour of how the system interacts with us. The system does not have emotional baggage to adapt to new behaviour. This is why we love systems, they do exactly what you program them to do. Nothing more and nothing less.
